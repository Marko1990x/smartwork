Real "tourism" only affected in Italy in the second half of the 17th century, with the beginning of the Grand Tour.
This was a period in which European aristocrats, many of whom were British, visited parts of Europe; Italy, Greece and
other Mediterranean places were amongst the most popular. This was in order to study ancient architecture and the local
culture.[3] The Grand Tour was in essence triggered by the book Voyage to Italy, by Roman Catholic priest Richard
Lassels, and published in 1670.[4][5] Due to the Grand Tour, tourism became even more prevalent - making Italy one of
the most desired destinations for millions of people.[6] Once inside what would be modern-day Italy, these tourists
would begin by visiting Turin for a short while. On the way there, Milan was also a popular stop, yet a trip to the
city was not considered essential, and several passed by, or simply stayed for a short period of time. If a person came
via boat, then they would remain a few days in Genoa. Yet, the main destination in Northern Italy was Venice, which was
considered a vital stop,[4] as well as cities around it such as Verona, Vicenza and Padua.

As the Tour went on, Tuscan cities were also very important itinerary stops. Florence was a major attraction, and other
Tuscan towns, such as Siena, Pisa, Lucca and San Gimignano, were also considered important destinations. The most
prominent stop in Central Italy, however, was Rome, a major centre for the arts and culture, as well as an essential
city for a Grand Tourist.[4] Later, they would go down to the Bay of Naples,[4] and after their discovery in 1710,
Pompeii and Herculaneum were popular too. Sicily was considered a significant part of the trail, and several, such as
Goethe, visited the island.

    The Eiffel Tower seen from the Place du Trocadéro
    Paris, the capital city of France, is the third most visited city in the world.[14]
    
    It has some of the world's largest and renowned museums, including the Louvre, which is the most visited art museum in
    the world, but also the Musée d'Orsay which, like the nearby Musée de l'Orangerie, is mostly devoted to impressionism,
    and Centre Georges Pompidou, dedicated to Contemporary art.
    
    Paris hosts some of the world's most recognizable landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, which is the most-visited paid
    monument in the world,[15] the Arc de Triomphe, the cathedral of Notre-Dame, or the Sacré-Cœur on Montmartre. The Cité
    des Sciences et de l'Industrie, located in Parc de la Villette, is the biggest science museum in Europe.[16] Near Paris
    are located the Palace of Versailles, the former palace of the Kings of France, now a museum, and the medieval village
    of Provins. Both attractions are protected as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

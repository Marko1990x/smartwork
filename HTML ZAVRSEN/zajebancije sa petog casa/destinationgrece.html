Tourism in Greece has been a key element of the economic activity in the country, and is one of the country's most
important sectors. Greece has been a major tourist destination and attraction in Europe since antiquity, for its rich
culture and history, which is reflected in large part by its 18 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, among the most in Europe
and the world[1] as well as for its long coastline, many islands, and beaches.[2]


The Egremnoi sand beach in the Greek island of Lefkada, noted for its blue crystal waters,[3] is a popular tourist
destination.
Greece attracted 26.5 million visitors in 2015, 30.1 million visitors in 2017 and over 33 million visitors are expected
in 2018, [4] [5] [6] [7][8] making Greece one of the most visited countries in Europe and the world, and contributing
18% to the nation's Gross Domestic Product.[9] Its capital city Athens, as well as Santorini, Mykonos, Rhodes, Corfu,
Crete and Chalkidice are some of the country's major tourist destinations.

In recent years, Greece has also promoted religious tourism and pilgrimages to regions with a significant historical
religious presence, such as the monasteries in Meteora and Mount Athos, in cooperation with other countries.[10]

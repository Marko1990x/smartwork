    Tourism in Spain is the 3rd major contributor to national economic life after the industrial and the business/banking
    sectors, contributing about 10-11% of Spain's GDP.[1] Ever since the 1960s and 1970s, the country has been a popular
    destination for summer holidays, especially with large numbers of tourists from the United Kingdom, France, Germany,
    Italy, the Benelux, and the United States, among others. Accordingly, Spain's foreign tourist industry has grown into
    the second-biggest in the world.[2]
